 Exercise Grade and feedback:

    - Your instructor will give you feedback on an exercise that does not fully meet requierments
    - You have about a month time to retry any exercise that is not a 10/10 as long as....
        - The initial exercise is turned in on time, otherwise the maximum is the late penelty


Late exercise policy:

While I HIGHLY encourage all to get a submission in by the Canvas deadline, here is the late grade policy:
-	As long as the submission reflects YOUR own attempt, (not a ChatGPT response or Google search result),
    the following turn in policy applies to the first submission -

            o	Zero – 5 days Late:
                  Up to full credit

            o	5 to 10 days late
                 Up to 8/10

            o	10 to 20 days late
                 Up to 6/10

            o	More then 20 days late
                  No score possible
