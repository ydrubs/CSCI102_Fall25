Exercise 3.2 - Sum of a sequence

The program asks the user for input and calculates the sum of sequence based on the following - 

    1. Ask the user for the first number in a sequence as a single integer digit.
    2. Ask the user for the number of terms in a sequence. 
    
    Calculate the sum of the sequence - for example:
        Starting digit is 3
        Number of terms is 5
        
        The program will calculate: 3+33+333+3333+33333
            ... The program returns 37035 as the answer
    HINT: Think about what you learned in chapter 2 about multiplying strings as well as when to recast to an int.
