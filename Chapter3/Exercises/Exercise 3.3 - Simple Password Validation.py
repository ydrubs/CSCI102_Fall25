Exercise 3.3 - Simple Password validation

Write a program that continues to ask the user for a password as long as the password is not 'password123'.

There is one caveat -  Every three incorrect entries, the program should ask the user "Are you sure you are not a robot":
    If the user responds with 'y' they can continue to put in the password.
    If they respond with 'n' the loop (and program) stops, you can give a funny message if you want.
