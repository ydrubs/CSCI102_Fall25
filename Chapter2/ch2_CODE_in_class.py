##Slide 2 - Example of comments and docstrings

# print(age)

"""
Sometimes there is a need to explain or document a portrion of code beyond one line.
For this we can use a docstring to extend to multiple lines.
Docstrings are also used to attribute programs and explain functions.

##Slide 5 - place value representation
a = 423_192_374_983_274
print(a, type(a))





##Slide 7 - String literals
pass # use double quotes of a single quote is part of the string

## Often the choice of single or double quote does not matter
# print("A double quoted string")
# print('does the same thing as a single quoted string')

# print("However, there'll be times when a string needs to include a single quote within it, so a double quote is useful.")


## Multiline strings look similar to docstrings
# welcomeText = '''Welcome to my game!
# I will think of a number from 1 to 100, and you must try
# to guess it. I'll tell you if your guess is too small
# or too large.

# Enter an integer between 1 and 100 when prompted.'''


# print(welcomeText)


##Slide 8 - Escape characters
# print('Hello. How are you?')
#
# print("1. hello " + 'there') #Substitute one of the escape chars for the '#'
# print("2. hello# " + ' there')
# print("3. hello# " + ' there')
# print("4. hello# " + ' there')
# print("5. hello# " + ' there')
# print("6. hello#' " + ' there')
# print("7.hello# " + ' there')




##Slide 10 - End of line arguments
# print("Hello")
# print("there")






##Slide 11 - separator arguments
# name = 'Yoda'
# age = 900
# home_planet = 'Dagobah'

## using sep


##  combine sep and end


###Activity from slide 13
## Three valid Variables


## Three Invalid variables



##Slide 14 - variable assignment through concatenation
# first_name = "Obi-Wan"
# last_name = "Kenobi"




## Reassigning Variables to new values
# x = 125
pass    # y defined in terms of x


pass   # redefining x



pass   # redefining y by modifying



##Slide 15 - Review Concatenation vs. comma seperation
# first_name = "Yuriy"
# last_name = "Drubinskiy"

pass # Concatenation
pass # comma seperated arguments


## Slide 16 - The * string operation
s1 = 'waaz'
s2 = 'a'
s3 = 'p'





### ACTIVITY slide 17 - Write a print statement that outputs the string seen in slide 17 of the powerpoint



##Slide 18 - Examples of math operations
pass #Exponents
pass # QUOTIENT
pass # Modulus (mod)
pass

pass
pass



# a = 1
pass # Increment and reassign to itself




## Slide 20 Mixed-Mode Arithmetic
# a = 6
# b = 3
pass
pass # True division Results in a float
pass # Quotient Division rounds down to an int


# c = 0.7
pass # Addition using at least one float always results in a float





#Slide 22 - recasting review
a = '33'
b = 5
c = 4.0
d = 'one'

pass # int to float
pass # float to str
pass # str to int
pass # str to int - ERROR


## SLide 23 rounding floats





##Slide 24 - Character operations
# s1 = "Mary"
# s2 = "Freddy"

pass #Get the lenght of string s1 and s2
pass # Get the ASCII code of the character
pass #Get the character from the ASCII code
pass #Find the smallest and largest ASCII character of s2


##Playing around with some character codes in unicode
