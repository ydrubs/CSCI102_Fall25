"""Password Validation Program

Write a program that asks the user to input a password and validates it. The password is valid as long as:
1) There is at least 8 characters
2) There is at least 1 lowercase letter
3) There is at least one upper case letter
4) There is at least one digit

If the program is valid, print something that says so, for example “Password has been set!”

If the password is not valid for anyone of the reasons given above the user is asked to re-enter a different password until the conditions are met.

_______________________________________________________________________
Optional features (Not required for full credit):
1) Add a fifth condition in which a special character (!,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,(, or ))
   needs to be included before a password is valid

2) If the password is valid, ask the user to confirm the password by re-entering
    it before accepting. If the confirmed password is different then the original,
    the process starts over (asks the user for a password, does validity check,
    asks for confirmation).
