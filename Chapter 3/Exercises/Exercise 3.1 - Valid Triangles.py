Exercise 3.1 - Valid Triangles

The triangle inequality theorem says in order for a triangle to be formed,

the sum of any two sides have to be greater than the third.

Write a program that accepts the length of three sides as float values

and outputs whether it is a valid triangle.

Remember that it should validate the triangle regardless of when the longest side is entered or if any of the sides are equal.
