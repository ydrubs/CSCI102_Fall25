Exercise 3.2a â€“ Pyramid Number Problem

A pyramidal number has the form 1^2+2^2+3^2+.......

for example the forth pyramidal number is 30 because:
    1^2+2^2+3^2^4^2 = 1+4+9+16=30

It is also known as the cannonball stacking number becasue it represents how much spherical cannonballs
can be stacked in a pyramid shape with a given number of rows.

Your program should:
    1) Ask the user how many rows of cannonballs they want to stack
    2) Calculate the total number of cannonballs that will create the pyramid with the specified rows
    
    For instance if the user says 4 - the return is 30 as described above.

Exercise 3.2b - Sum of a sequence

The program asks the user for input and calculates the sum of sequence based on the following - 

    1. Ask the user for the first number in a sequence as a single integer digit.
    2. Ask the user for the number of terms in a sequence. 
    
    Calculate the sum of the sequence - for example:
        Starting digit is 3
        Number of terms is 5
        
        The program will calculate: 3+33+333+3333+33333
            ... The program returns 37035 as the answer
    HINT: Think about what you learned in chapter 2 about multiplying strings as well as when to recast to an int.
