Exercise 5.4 - Consecutive Zero's

Write a function that accepts a string containing only 1's and 0's.
The function returns the maximum number of consecutive 0's in the string.

For example if the string is
    - 1001000010, the function would return four
    - 110110111, the function would return 1
    - 1111111, the function would return 0

Note: Your string should RETURN the value NOT print it in the function

Also keep in mind to use the concepts/commands we learned in class for this, no Python 'tricks' or shortcuts.
Of course, functions SHOULD be used now.

OPTIONAL Exercise for an addtional challenge (not graded)- 

Palindromes â€“ A palindrome is a word that reads the same forward and backward. Some examples are:
        - civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak, madam, and refer.

Write a function called palindrome_checker that accepts a one word string and returns whether the word is a palindrome.

The checker should NOT be case-sensitive so civic == Civic == CIVIC

Demonstrate the functionality of the Palindrome checker by calling the function with the argument 'Bob'.
