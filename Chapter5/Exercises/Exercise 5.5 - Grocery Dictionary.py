Exercise 5.5 - Grocery Dictionary

1)	Create a dictionary called grocery_cart
2)	Ask the user for input 3 times. Each time the user should be asked to enter an item then the price of that item.
3)	Each input should be recorded into the dictionary as a Key-value pair where the key is the item and value is the price.
4)	Print the dictionary to the terminal
5)	Use the sum() command to find the total cost of the items (using a dictionary method of course, not direct inputs from step 2)
