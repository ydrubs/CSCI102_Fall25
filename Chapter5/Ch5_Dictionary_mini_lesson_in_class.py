A DICTIONARY is a Python data type that links to pieces of data together inside of curly-brackets {}
    The first piece of data is called the KEY
    The second piece of data is called the VALUE

#Define a dictionary



# We can use the .keys() and the .values() method to view the keys and values separately



# We can add to a dictionary by specifying the KEY and setting it equal to a value



    # Create a dictionary entry from user input




#Dictionary are NOT ORDERED meaning we CAN'T use their INDEX to access them or manipulate them



#Create a dictionary using a loop



# Dictionaries KEYS have to be UNIQUE, otherwise, the LAST entry will overwrite the previous similar one




# We can perform operations on dictionary keys:
d = {'a': 13, 'b': 7, 'c' : 12}

    # Add up all the values
    # Error because can't add strings
