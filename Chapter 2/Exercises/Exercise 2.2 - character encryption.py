Exercise 2.2 - Character Encryption

This is a  simple encryption program that turns a single character into another character
Do the following:

    1) Ask the user for a single letter (character)
    2) Ask the user for a number
    3) Print the character that would result when the input character is shifted by the value in entered

    Example:
        - User enters 'a'
        - User enters 5
        - The result would output 'f'
