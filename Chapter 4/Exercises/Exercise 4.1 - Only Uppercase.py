Exercise 4.1 - Only Uppercase

Ask the user for an input string.

The program should print a string that only contains the uppercase letters from the string the user entered.

For example:
    If the user enters: 'The Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over the Lazy Dog'
    The string printed should be: 'TQBFJOLD'

            Since those are the capital letters in the first string
